The midterm project report is a proposal of your term project. Specific requirements for the midterm project report may include:
- All team members should participate in discussion and contribute in the report. One team should not have more than 3 members. Students can choose to work independently without forming a team.
- Report should not exceed three pages, double spaced.
- Report should briefly describe the topic and its significance in biomedical research. Literature should be surveyed and some key references should be cited and appended (not count towards the three page limit) in a format of formal publications.
- Specific aims should be proposed. Aims define what goals you plan to achieve in the project and may vary from project to project. However each project must contain one component, that is to write codes to analyze at least one type of high throughput bioinformatic data.
