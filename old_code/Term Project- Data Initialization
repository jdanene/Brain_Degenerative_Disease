#Key Note: For each data set, we are only going to work with 3 of the temporal conditions and will delete the rest.(note that all time points have 3 replicates)
#These will be: (1)The control set (2)The minimum time response (Early stage Alzheimer's and 0.5hr after Brain Trauma) 
#(3) The maximum time response (Late Stage Alzheimer's and 504 hrs after Brain Trauma)

#In summary: 
#For CTE: we will look at:
# (1)Control data set at 0hr (3 replicates)
#(2)0.5hrs for control and brain trauma conditions (3 replicates each)
#(3)504hrs for control and brain trauma conditions (2 replicates each)

#For Alzheimer's we will look at:

#Read and extracted the CEL file data

#isn't the case, then please change the Labeling

##Key Note: these labels may not necessarily be correct. I assumed that the cel files
#are added in ascending order (lowest number file name to highest #)
##Also note that I am not sure where the control data is. I believe that each 
#replicate likely holds the control data too.
#Label has 3months=N, 23 months= T
