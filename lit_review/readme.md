# Current Proposal 
Compare gene enrichment and expression in samples belonging to mice afflicted with two different, but related conditions: CTE and Alzheimer's Disease. Both involve Tau proteins and likely others as well. Compare microarray data on mice with CTE under brain trauma conditions after 24hrrs, 48hrs, etc, and also early and late stage alzheimer's disease mice. Essentially, we are looking to compare and hopefully elucidate new information on the diseases by comparing relevant microarray data. 

# Outline
### Introduction
 - Connection between miliary and football I like this [link]( https://actaneurocomms.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40478-018-0619-9) nice intro that catches the readers attention about CTE. Need to find a similar example for alzheimer’s. 
 - neurodegenerative diseases all seem to be link <how>, brief cite some studies
 - Cite Research that talks about the link between CTE and Alzheimer. 
### Goal
  - The main reason for our study. 
      - Is it because CTE only diagnosed by analyzing a dead brain and if we can find some genetic markers that are similar betwwen a related disease, we can do some molecular profiling for early diagnosis. 
      - Is it to look at how Alzheimer's disease is treated early, see if similar mechanism for treating Alzheimer early can be used for CTE. Ealry diagnosis of CTE may not a issue since we can be reasonably sure that with repeated blows a player has a high chance of CTE, so why do we care about early diagnosis. 
 >> American football players, 99% of former National Football League (NFL) players were neuropathologically diagnosed with CTE at autopsy. Although the frequency of CTE in individuals with less football exposure was substantial, it was nonetheless lower (highest level of play - college: 91%; highest level of play – high school: 21%

### Analysis
 - Derived from our goal. Get more techincal and describe how we aim to achive our goal. Similar to what Will suggested in his `Specific aim` section.
