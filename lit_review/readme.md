Functional grouping analysis


#### 
Find groups of genes that share similar expression patterns over the two conditions. Find common tedency for genes to share common roles in celluar processes. Since it is a time series we can also analyis gene co-expression patterns. Find observed coregulation at the level of cellular function. BY focusing on mice relationshio among the functions of genes in clustors will be more complete the the functional annotation of guman gene sequences, so we have an advatage in terms of interpreting our findings. In our cluster analysis we expect to find that the clusters of functionally related genes are maintaned, bbut we aim to expand our analysis with the addition of the expected uncharateized genes, with the goal of making at least provisional attribution of function on a genomic scale.  Are main goal is to glean a comprehensive representation of the state of the cell throughout it response to brain trauma, and through the cognitive decline, and see if the state evolution coinscide. If they do, then this suggest that their is a unified approach to treating neurodegenerative diseases. Not entirely sure of the m

gene expression profiling is the measurement of the activity (the expression) of thousands of genes at once, to create a global picture of cellular function. These profiles can, for example, distinguish between cells that are actively dividing, or show how the cells react to a particular treatment. Many experiments of this sort measure an entire genome simultaneously, that is, every gene present in a particular cell.

Genes that are expressed togther share common functions. Gial gene expression patterns suffice to separate genes into functional categories of the two conditions

Map back to the available functional information on the genes studied

Traumatic brain injuty induces a cascade of biochemical responses, both nuerotxxic and neuroprotective substantially determine subseq tissue loss and associated functional deficits. 
Molecular mechanisms underlying delayed response to traumatic brain injury not fully understood. 

Expand on findings by using analytical techniques in deep learning to find significant expressision groups of genes and map them back to functional categories. 

Hypothesis that common changes acrpss pathobiologically different models of brain trauma and age-related neurodegneration may help identify the more importnat sec

- Alterations in multiple molecular processes develop in the brain during aging or Alzheimer's disease(AD), some of which correlate with cognitive impairment. See if ageing-dependent upregulated processes coinscide w/ brain-trauma induced  processes. Since many of these aging-sensitive genes/processes are correlate with cognitive dyfunction. Link the key early events in cognitive dysfunction. Study attempts to identify the earliest detectable aging changes in expression, and study the changes that develop concurrently w/ the onset og cognitive impariment. We may not be able to establish cause and effect, but my matching with our traumatic brain injury model, we may be able to separate detrumanl from compensatory effects, further more we may be bale to generate unuqie inseiys on the processes that are shared by brain and cofnitve aging and braain trauma,

### Sources of Experimental Data
We leverage two sets of Microarray data , gene expression changes across different brain injury models (fluid percussion vs controlled cortical) in rats [?1], and hippocampal gene/protien expression and cognitive function in rats across the adult lifespan [?2]. Our goal is to quantify the similarity of the mechanisms underlying brain damage after traumatic injury, to the mechanisms underlying cognitive decline during aging. To this end, perform a pathway analyses, also called a gene-set analyses (GSA), to identify sets of genes that are jointly associated. Honing our focus on testing the cumulative effect of multiple single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in our two datasets. The current method of analyis for this step is undertermined but we are currently considering cluster analyis [?3], gene co-expression network analyis. As observed from network based studies Since brain gene expression is organized into modules of distinct functional categories.

2008; Emilsson et al., 2008; Zhang and Horvath, 2005)

In order to identify common gene expression changes across the different injury models and the adult rats lifespan. Our goal is to see 

temporal gene expression patterns for brain injury model, see if these patterns match gene-expression patterns for the micr going through cognitive decline. 

Speed of changes equivilant to those seen in aging over a lifespan.

# Concusion
We conclude that although NES and SD exert similar transcriptional changes, selective presynaptic release machinery and Homer1 expression changes are seen in SD. Among other changes, the marked decrease in Homer1 expression with age may represent an important divergence between young and aged brain response to SD. Based on this, it seems reasonable to conclude that therapeutic strategies designed to promote sleep in young subjects may have off-target effects in the aged. Finally, this work identifies presynaptic vesicular release and intercellular adhesion molecular signatures as novel therapeutic targets to counter effects of SD in young subjects.

# Current Proposal 
Compare gene enrichment and expression in samples belonging to mice afflicted with two different, but related conditions: CTE and Alzheimer's Disease. Both involve Tau proteins and likely others as well. Compare microarray data on mice with CTE under brain trauma conditions after 24hrrs, 48hrs, etc, and also early and late stage alzheimer's disease mice. Essentially, we are looking to compare and hopefully elucidate new information on the diseases by comparing relevant microarray data. 

# Outline
### Introduction
 - Connection between miliary and football I like this [link]( https://actaneurocomms.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40478-018-0619-9) nice intro that catches the readers attention about CTE. Need to find a similar example for alzheimer’s. 
 - neurodegenerative diseases all seem to be link <how>, brief cite some studies
 - Cite Research that talks about the link between CTE and Alzheimer. 
### Goal
  - The main reason for our study. 
      - Is it because CTE only diagnosed by analyzing a dead brain and if we can find some genetic markers that are similar betwwen a related disease, we can do some molecular profiling for early diagnosis. 
      - Is it to look at how Alzheimer's disease is treated early, see if similar mechanism for treating Alzheimer early can be used for CTE. Ealry diagnosis of CTE may not a issue since we can be reasonably sure that with repeated blows a player has a high chance of CTE, so why do we care about early diagnosis. 
 >> American football players, 99% of former National Football League (NFL) players were neuropathologically diagnosed with CTE at autopsy. Although the frequency of CTE in individuals with less football exposure was substantial, it was nonetheless lower (highest level of play - college: 91%; highest level of play – high school: 21%
